        <dt><h3>What is Ether-Mart?</h3></dt>
        <dd>Ether-Mart is a decentralized, censorship-resistant online marketplace. It is run by a set of smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain. The UI is a browser-based web application, but the smart contract can also be accessed directly by anyone.</dd>		 
        <br>
        <dt><h3>What do I need in order to purchase items?</h3></dt>
        <dd>You need a Metamask account to purchase items on Ether-Mart. Your identity is based on your Ethereum public address. <p></p>In order to receive your items, you must have an email address registered at the time of the transaction. The seller will reach you to you directly once payment is completed to to request further shipping instructions.</dd>		 
        <br>
        <dt><h3>What shipping method is used?</h3></dt>
        <dd>Currently, the Ether-Mart online marketplace is only available to US residents in the contiguous United States (lower 48 states, including District of Columbia). Shipping fees are included in the listed item price. It is the seller's responsibility to list the default shipping method used on their store page or product page. Typically, the default shipping method used by most merchants is either USPS or UPS/Fedex ground shipping. <p>We are currently working on upgrading Ether-Mart to separate the shipping costs from the item price. Due to the transparent nature of the blockchain, the inital version of Ether-Mart will require only an email address for purchases and a follow-up interaction between the buyer and seller (through e-mail). It is entirely up to the two parties whether or not to negotiate a different shipping method or to ship to an address outside the contiguous United States.</p></dd>		 
        <br>
        <dt><h3>What methods of payment are accepted?</h3></dt>
        <dd>Currently, only Ether (ETH) is a valid form of payment. The funds are sent directly to the seller at the time of the transaction. Ether-Mart.com is only a user-interface to the smart contract's functionality and does not directly handle any payments.</dd>
        <br>
        <dt><h3>How can I request a refund or exchange?</h3></dt>
        <dd>On Ethereum, payments are settled at the time of the transaction. This means that funds are immediately received by the seller and it is the obligation of the seller to ship your items. If you have any questions about your order, please reach out to the seller through their email address provided on their store page. Also, look for a refund & exchange policy on the seller's store page.</dd>
        <br>
        <dt><h3>How can I settle a dispute with the seller?</h3></dt>
        <dd>Given the censorship-resistant nature of the platform, anyone is able to add a storefront and sell their products. There are several ways a buyer can verify the integrity of a seller: <p></p> <ul><li>Does the seller have any transaction history? Check the seller's public address on Etherscan to get an idea of the seller's sales activity. The higher number of transactions, the more likely it is the seller is reputable.</li><li>Check the seller's sales rating on their store page (future feature upgrade).</li><li>Reach out to the seller directly with any questions before purchasing an item.<p>We do not have the ability to refund your purchase or otherwise mediate in your transaction. Ether-Mart only provides an interface for the Etherum smart contract that facilitates the online marketplace functionality. Please take extra caution when using this platform and consider who you are doing business with. We provide no guarantees whatsoever.</p></li></ul> </dd>
        <br>
        <dt><h3>How can I become a seller?</h3></dt>
        <dd>Anyone is able to add a storefront and sell their products. As a seller, you have a certain responsibility to act as a fair merchant. Due to the immutable nature of the blockchain, numerous negative ratings on your Ethereum address may permanently negatively impact your ability to attract customers. <p>Please note that due to a limitation in how to handle shipping, shipping costs are assumed to be included in the item's price. In other words, by listing an item, you agree to provide free shipping to anyone in the contiguous United States. Please keep this in mind when setting your prices.</p><p>Please visit "My Account" page for more information.</p></li></ul> </dd>
